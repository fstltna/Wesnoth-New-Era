Scenario 10
Name: Return to the Northlands
Story:
[legends_of_the_north.ogg] The orcs and undead easily defended the cave
stronghold and when the water subsided, the nagas were driven off or slain,
their magical artifact exhausted.
[northerners.ogg] Months later, Gwiti finished studying the Tome of Crelanu and
departed for where he believed the other half of Morgorath's skull to be. The
orcs, restless without an enemy to fight, eagerly followed.
