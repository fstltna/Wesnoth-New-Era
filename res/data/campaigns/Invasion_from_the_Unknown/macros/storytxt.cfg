Therefore, it is especially important to pay close attention to the mission objectives and to not necessarily try to kill every single enemy, especially in shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn continuously.

Although not strictly a requirement, I recommend for players to have played or read the storylines behind Descent into Darkness and Under the Burning Suns, to be familiar with some characters and historical events."
