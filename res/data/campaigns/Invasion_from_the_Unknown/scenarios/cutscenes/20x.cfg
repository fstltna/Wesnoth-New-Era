        {MSG_UNIT (Althurin) ( _ "Oh ho! But they know, as well as we, that ye wouldn't last for long without some help! What, tryin' to reach the Dark Fortress? Nay, ye couldn't do it alone. We've seen it, and 'tis a very well guarded fortress.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "In fact, we are quite astonished that ye managed to come this far.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "Yes, but please, Your Majesty, you have seen it? Where is this 'fortress'?")}

Nasty, unspeakable things happen there, and the guards are a plague that infests every corner of the Dark Valley. You ought to see it for yourself, 'tis a horrible sight for a sober dwarf. What d'ye plan, lad? Invasion, or infiltration, perchance?")}

An' since we don't have the magic craft required to defeat the Dark Emperor, it shall be yer task to put that force to work inside the Heart of the Empire. The least we could do is serve as a distraction, bait for the Chaos army. Not a pleasant thought to be sure, but my axe needs the exercise.")}
