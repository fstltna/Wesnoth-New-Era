The loyalists are already aware of our presence here and they won't stop until they have Knalga and our lives along with it. Why they're so obsessed with these mountains is unknown to me, but anyone can see they have a plan brewin'.")}

There are many skilled fighters and wisemen on their side, but that'll never be enough. If we dwarves couldn't resist the enemy forces with our most advanced technology, then there is no possibility those less-advanced outsiders could manage it.")}

When I was just an apprentice, I witnessed and participated in a war during which a great alliance was forged - it even included the orcish tribes of the North. We were fighting against a necromancer who had coincidentally established his own empire, the First Empire of Wesnoth. I am deeply disappointed; I didn't figure on you forgetting those events.")}

However, I am certain that we can form a new super-alliance to defeat the Chaos Empire and put an end to this great evil that has befallen the world.

        {MSG_UNIT (King Asthorgar) ( _ "I understand and agree, but how are we going to make sure the demons don't follow us? We can block the tunnels, but with their machines it'd be just a small delay in the end. We need a distraction, a decoy.")}

And death itself is not the worst thing that can happen to me. I have indirectly committed great crimes in the past, sacrificing our people for an evil cause. I cannot erase my past. If I am going to die, then I would prefer it be by sacrificing myself for our people - this time for a just cause. It is the best I can do to repair the damage I caused back then.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "My plan is to stay here fighting and distracting the demons, with a little help from Keshar's power over the deceased. Only me and the dead, while you flee to the outside unnoticed. I'll fight for as long as possible, and try to find the assault commander to vanquish him, if possible. That way you would have already escaped north by the time they learn that you are missing.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "In that case, I'll set some of my minions to aid you. And I wish you the best of luck - may your soul rest in peace when all this is over.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "It saddens me to see what must happen so that our kind survives. I swear that I'll not rest until the last of those fiends is turned to cinders on the ground.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "You are still a young and brave warrior, Galas. Your time to lead our people to glory is approaching. I, in contrast, have already passed that time, though I have never been a warrior. With my crimes I cannot be a leader; but you, your future is to be a leader.")}
