To be honest, it was Anlindë and Mal Keshar who led and protected them until we left them in the North; they proved to be better leaders than I. Now that they have established a new home, they can protect themselves - as for a leader... I am sure they can choose someone better than me.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Since the Heart Fortress was destroyed and buried deep into the ground, we cannot investigate it and determine the nature and origins of Yechnagoth and her relatives. However, there is still that island left, where the Quenoth elves had once established a home. I want to examine the place and obtain further information from Tanuil's lore-keepers.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "That seems a fair plan. But, how are we going to make it there?")}

        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Something still disturbs me, though. We set Argan free from his suffering, as we did with Lédinor. We expected the demons to be vanquished once the connection with Inferno was cut...and although we literally buried it, that did not happen. If Elyssa somehow survived that disaster...")}

        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "And then there's Mal Hekuba and the Iron Council. I suspect they won't give up that easily.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "However, now that the war has started, those foes will be a problem that the northern races will have to face themselves. I believe that learning about Yechnagoth's nature, and anything else we can find in Zocthanol connected to the Chaos Empire, is more important than playing with an unknown enemy.")}
