Do you prefer to continue your lives defending your country from the ocassional raiders, until a real attack force is sent after you to obliterate your race? I for one, don't, and that is why I risked my people fleeing from our home valley, that is why many lives have already been lost, and that is the only thing we can do to make sure our dead rest in peace.")}

We, elves, have wished and wished that the continent returns to be as it once was, but as we have seen, there is nothing that can be done without our own help. We want to see free people again, free lands clear of any evil.")}

That is why many lives have already been lost, and that is the only thing we can do to make sure our dead rest in peace.")}
